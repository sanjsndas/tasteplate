                <p>This Cookie Policy explains how TastePlate ("we," "our," or "us") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at TastePlate.com ("Site"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.

                <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, TastePlate) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>

                <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
                <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. For example, TastePlate uses cookies to remember your preferences, such as language settings or login status, making your future visits more convenient and personalized. These cookies help us to understand how our website is being used, allowing us to continuously improve its functionality and content based on user behavior. Furthermore, certain cookies are used for advertising purposes, helping us to deliver more relevant advertisements to you based on your interests and browsing patterns. This ensures that the ads you see are more likely to be of interest to you, making your overall experience with TastePlate more engaging and less intrusive. We also use cookies for security purposes, helping to detect and prevent fraudulent activities and protect your account. The detailed information gathered through these cookies allows us to analyze website traffic, identify popular content, and troubleshoot technical issues, all contributing to a smoother and more efficient user experience. Our commitment to using cookies responsibly and transparently means that we only deploy them for legitimate purposes that benefit both our users and the operational integrity of TastePlate. We continuously review our cookie usage to ensure compliance with evolving privacy regulations and best practices, demonstrating our dedication to safeguarding your information. This proactive approach to managing cookie usage is a critical component of our overall privacy framework, reinforcing your trust in TastePlate. We believe that empowering users to choose how their browsing data is collected and used is fundamental to building a trustworthy and user-centric platform. This commitment to user control is a core pillar of our data privacy philosophy, ensuring that your preferences are always honored.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Explanation of Cookies and Their Use (40 Points)</h2>

                <h3>1. Essential/Strictly Necessary Cookies:</h3>
                <p>These cookies are absolutely vital for the basic functionality of our website and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. Without these cookies, certain parts of the website, such as secure areas or shopping carts, would not function correctly. They enable core features like security, network management, and accessibility. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information. Their primary role is to ensure the smooth operation and security of the website, making your navigation and interaction with TastePlate seamless and secure. Blocking these cookies might lead to parts of the site not working as intended, significantly impacting your user experience. We use these cookies to manage user sessions, ensure the correct display of content, and facilitate secure transactions, all of which are fundamental to providing a functional online platform. They are a cornerstone of our website's stability and reliability, ensuring that essential services are always available to you without interruption. This category of cookies is critical for maintaining the operational integrity of TastePlate and providing a consistent user experience. We prioritize their security and ensure they are used only for their intended, necessary purposes, demonstrating our commitment to a robust and secure online environment. Their short lifespan and limited data collection are designed to maximize functionality while minimizing privacy impact. We continuously monitor their performance to ensure they are optimized for efficiency and security, reflecting our dedication to a high-quality user experience.</p>

                <h3>2. Performance/Analytical Cookies:</h3>
                <p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance. This data helps us understand user behavior patterns, identify areas for improvement, and optimize content strategy. For example, by analyzing which recipes are most frequently viewed, we can prioritize content development in those areas. These cookies provide valuable insights into website usage trends, allowing us to make data-driven decisions to enhance the overall quality and usability of TastePlate. They are crucial for understanding how our users interact with the platform, enabling us to refine our design, content, and features based on real-world usage data. This continuous analysis ensures that TastePlate remains relevant and engaging for our community. We use reputable third-party analytics providers for this purpose, who are committed to data protection and adhere to strict privacy standards. The anonymized nature of the data collected ensures that your personal privacy is respected while still providing us with the necessary insights for platform improvement. This commitment to data-driven enhancement, balanced with unwavering privacy protection, is a core pillar of our cookie policy. We continuously review their effectiveness and impact on user experience, demonstrating our dedication to providing a high-quality and user-centric platform. Their role in identifying popular content and navigation issues is vital for our ongoing development efforts, ensuring that TastePlate evolves in a way that truly meets user needs.</p>

                <h3>3. Functionality Cookies:</h3>
                <p>These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. For example, they can remember your username, language preferences, or region. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly. These cookies are designed to improve your user experience by remembering your choices and settings, making your future visits more convenient and tailored to your preferences. They allow for features such as remembering your login details, customizing content based on your past interactions, or providing personalized recommendations. This personalization helps to create a more engaging and efficient browsing experience on TastePlate. They can also facilitate features like comment sections or embedded video players, ensuring a rich and interactive environment. While they may collect some personal information (like a username), this is always done with the purpose of enhancing your experience and is subject to your consent. We are committed to using these cookies responsibly, ensuring that they genuinely add value to your interaction with our site. This commitment to user convenience and personalization, balanced with privacy protection, is a core pillar of our cookie policy. We continuously review their impact on user experience and ensure they are optimized for efficiency and security, reflecting our dedication to a high-quality user experience. Their role in remembering user preferences is vital for creating a seamless and tailored browsing experience, ensuring that TastePlate adapts to your individual needs and choices.</p>

                <h3>4. Targeting/Advertising Cookies:</h3>
                <p>These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. These cookies track your browsing habits and activity across websites to understand your interests and preferences. This allows our advertising partners to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you, making the ads you see more useful and less intrusive. For example, if you frequently view recipes for baking, you might see ads for baking tools or ingredients. While these cookies do not directly store personally identifiable information, they can create a profile of your online behavior. We are committed to ensuring that our advertising partners adhere to strict data protection standards and provide clear mechanisms for opting out of personalized advertising. Your consent for these cookies is obtained through our cookie banner, and you have the right to withdraw it at any time. This commitment to ethical advertising practices, balanced with user control, is a core pillar of our cookie policy. We continuously review their effectiveness and impact on user experience, demonstrating our dedication to providing a high-quality and user-centric platform. Their role in delivering relevant advertisements is vital for supporting our free content and services, ensuring that TastePlate remains accessible to all users. We strive to make advertising on TastePlate as unobtrusive and relevant as possible, always prioritizing your privacy preferences and providing clear options for managing your ad experience. This proactive approach to managing advertising cookies is an integral part of our broader commitment to ethical online operations.</p>

                <h3>5. First-Party Cookies:</h3>
                <p>These cookies are set directly by TastePlate and are essential for the proper functioning of our website. They are typically used to remember your preferences, manage your login session, or track your activity on our site for analytical purposes.

                <h3>8. Persistent Cookies:</h3>
                <p>These cookies remain in your browser's cookie file even after you close the browser, for a set period or until you delete them. They are used to remember your preferences or actions across multiple visits to a website. For example, a persistent cookie might remember your language preference or that you've already accepted the cookie policy, so you don't have to select it again on your next visit. They are crucial for personalization and convenience, enhancing your long-term user experience on TastePlate. These cookies can store information about your preferences, login status, or past interactions to provide a more tailored experience on subsequent visits. Their extended lifespan allows for features like "remember me" functionality or personalized content recommendations.

                <h3>10. HTTP-Only Cookies:</h3>
                <p>These cookies are designed to be inaccessible to client-side scripts (like JavaScript). This helps to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where malicious scripts might attempt to steal cookie data. By making certain cookies HTTP-only, we enhance the security of your session and account information. This means that even if a malicious script were to be injected into our website, it would not be able to access the content of these specific cookies, significantly reducing the risk of session hijacking. HTTP-only cookies are primarily used for storing sensitive session identifiers or authentication tokens. They are a crucial security measure that protects your login credentials and ensures the integrity of your authenticated session on TastePlate.

                <h3>11. Web Beacons/Tracking Pixels:</h3>
                <p>These are tiny graphic images (often just one pixel by one pixel) that are embedded in web pages or emails. They are used to track user behavior, such as whether an email has been opened or if a specific page has been visited. For instance, we might use a web beacon in our newsletter to see if subscribers are opening our emails, which helps us gauge the effectiveness of our email campaigns and refine our content strategy. These technologies do not directly collect personally identifiable information, but they can provide valuable insights into user engagement and content performance. When used in conjunction with cookies, they can help us understand your journey through our website and your interactions with our content. We use these technologies responsibly and transparently, always with the goal of improving your experience and the effectiveness of our services. We do not use web beacons or tracking pixels to secretly collect personal information without your knowledge. This commitment to ethical data collection practices extends to ensuring that all tracking technologies are used in a way that respects your privacy and provides you with control over your data.

                <h3>12. Local Storage (HTML5):</h3>
                <p>Similar to cookies, local storage allows websites to store data directly in the browser. However, local storage has a larger capacity (typically 5MB-10MB) and the data does not expire, meaning it persists even after the browser is closed, unless explicitly cleared by the user. We may use local storage to remember certain user preferences or to store temporary data that enhances your browsing experience, such as your cookie consent choice. This allows for faster loading times and a more seamless user experience by reducing the need to fetch data from the server repeatedly. Unlike cookies, local storage data is not automatically sent with every HTTP request, which can improve performance. We are committed to using local storage responsibly and transparently, ensuring that any data stored is for legitimate purposes that enhance your interaction with TastePlate. This commitment to user convenience and personalization, balanced with privacy protection, is a core pillar of our cookie policy. We continuously review its effectiveness and impact on user experience, demonstrating our dedication to providing a high-quality and user-centric platform. Its role in remembering user preferences and optimizing performance is vital for creating a seamless and efficient browsing experience, ensuring that TastePlate remains responsive and user-friendly.

They work similarly to web beacons, enabling us to track events like page views, button clicks, or form submissions. This data helps us understand user behavior in detail, allowing us to optimize our website's design, content, and functionality. For example, a JavaScript tag might track how many users click on a specific recipe image, providing insights into content popularity. This information is typically aggregated and anonymized, meaning it cannot be used to identify you personally. We use these tags to gather valuable insights into website usage trends, enabling us to make data-driven decisions to enhance the overall quality and usability of TastePlate. They are crucial for understanding how our users interact with the platform, allowing us to refine our design, content, and features based on real-world usage data. This continuous analysis ensures that TastePlate remains relevant and engaging for our community. We use reputable third-party analytics providers for this purpose, who are committed to data protection and adhere to strict privacy standards. The anonymized nature of the data collected ensures that your personal privacy is respected while still providing us with the necessary insights for platform improvement. This commitment to data-driven enhancement, balanced with unwavering privacy protection, is a core pillar of our cookie policy. We continuously review their effectiveness and impact on user experience, demonstrating our dedication to providing a high-quality and user-centric platform.

Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan, ranging from a few days to several years, depending on their purpose and the settings configured by the website or third party. For example, a cookie remembering your login might expire after 30 days, while an analytics cookie might persist for two years. We ensure that cookies are not kept longer than necessary for their intended purpose. The expiration dates are carefully chosen to balance user convenience with data minimization.
